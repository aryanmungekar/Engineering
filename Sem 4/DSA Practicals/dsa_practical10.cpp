Algorithm:
Build a Max-Heap:
Read the marks obtained by each student in the subject.
Insert each mark into a max-heap data structure.
Find Maximum Mark:
The maximum mark will be the root of the max-heap.
Find Minimum Mark:
To find the minimum mark, build a min-heap and repeat the process for finding the maximum mark. The minimum mark will be the root of the min-heap.
Analysis:
Building Max-Heap:
Time Complexity: O(n log n) using standard heap insertion for n marks.
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the marks in the heap.
Finding Maximum Mark:
Time Complexity: O(1) as it only requires accessing the root of the max-heap.
Space Complexity: O(1).
Finding Minimum Mark:
Building the min-heap: O(n log n) similar to building the max-heap.
Finding the minimum mark: O(1) as it only requires accessing the root of the min-heap.
Overall Time Complexity: O(n log n).
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the marks in the min-heap.
Real-World Considerations:
Handling Large Datasets:
Efficient implementation techniques should be employed for handling large datasets, such as using a binary heap or priority queue.
Error Handling:
Ensure proper error handling for cases where there are no marks or invalid inputs.
Optimization:
For a one-time operation, simple sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort may be more efficient than building a heap.
Conclusion:
Using a heap data structure allows us to efficiently find the maximum and minimum marks obtained by students in a particular subject. By analyzing the algorithm, we understand its time and space complexity, enabling us to make informed decisions regarding its implementation and potential optimizations.*/
