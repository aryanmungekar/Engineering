/*
Modularization: To improve code readability and maintainability, consider breaking down the code into separate functions. For example, you could create a function to handle LED illumination based on the counter value.
Analog Inputs: Instead of using a static counter, you could incorporate analog inputs from sensors to dynamically change the counter value based on real-world parameters. This could make the program more versatile and applicable to various scenarios.
Brightness Control: If you're using LEDs capable of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), you could vary the brightness of the LEDs based on the counter value. This would provide a finer level of control over the visual output.
Feedback Mechanism: Implementing feedback mechanisms such as serial communication with a computer or displaying the counter value on an LCD screen could provide real-time feedback on the system's operation.
Error Handling: Integrate error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected scenarios, such as sensor failures or out-of-range counter values. This could involve setting default LED states or triggering specific actions in case of errors.
Optimization: Look for opportunities to optimize the code for efficiency, such as minimizing delays or reducing power consumption. This is especially important for battery-powered or resource-constrained applications.
Expansion: Consider expanding the program to control additional peripherals or integrate with other systems. For example, you could add functionality to log data to an SD card or communicate with other Arduino boards via wireless modules.
Documentation: Provide thorough documentation within the code, including comments and explanations of the program's functionality, pin connections, and any external dependencies.

Conclusion:
This Arduino program illustrates how to control multiple LEDs based on a counter variable. By using conditional statements, we can determine which LED to illuminate based on the value of the counter. This program can be extended to incorporate additional functionality or be used as a basis for more complex projects involving multiple sensors and actuators.
